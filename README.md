# PythonFlaskProject-1
First project on the path to understanding data engineering - Blog 
Following an established raodmap for data engineering this is the first project. While the design and aesthetic components have not been completed the website is 
functional and users are able to perform CRUD operations on the data in the blog. 
This is also my first introduction to data modelling in python flask framework.
